I started this project to replace a google drive folder sharing. I want to create a webapp where all students see there training folders and files, not more, in just 1 simple location. 

Te scan program checkes if the file and/or folder
* Is already present in database? 
* If so, check name and update if changed (but keep ID)
* If not, add folder/file to database and create Unique ID and save it's parent folder

### Scan Directory Program:

---- 
Futher developing of this project is in a Private Repository as the code is getting complex and I don't want it public. 
### What is private, already done and also in development?
* Showing Folders and files
* Creating trainings and link folders to trainings
* Create users and link trainings to users
* Create new folders and add files
* upload file system
* .. much more ;-)
